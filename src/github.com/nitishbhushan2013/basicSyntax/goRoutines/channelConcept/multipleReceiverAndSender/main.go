/* channel is the way to send or recieve value to channel type. Generally, it helps us to communicate
between routine and represented by <-

By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.
So channel send/receive operations block until the other side is ready:

1. A send operation on a channel blocks until a receiver is available for the same channel: if thereâ€™s no recipient for the value on ch, no other value can be put in the channel. And the other way around: no new value can be sent in ch when the channel is not empty! So the send operation will wait until ch becomes available again.

2. A receive operation for a channel blocks until a sender is available for the same channel: if there is no value in the channel, the receiver blocks.
